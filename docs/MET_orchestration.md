# **üèó Platforms and Their Purposes**

**1\. Salesforce Sales Cloud (Sales)**

* Purpose: Manage **Opportunities, Quotes, Orders**.

* Trigger: When a device is sold, traded in, or purchased on mrp.io.

* Output: Auto-creates a **Service Cloud Case** for fulfillment.

**2\. Salesforce Service Cloud (Service)**

* Purpose: Manage **Cases, Entitlements, SLAs, Customer Support**.

* Used by: Customer service staff (CSRs) and management.

* Trigger: Any customer support issue (broken device, handpiece, training request).

* Output: Case Router sends job request to MET; syncs updates from MET/Jira back to Case.

**3\. MET (Marketplace for External Service Providers)**

* Purpose: Coordinate **external service providers** (techs, trainers, drivers, medical directors).

* Flow:

  * Case Router pushes job request into MET.

  * Providers **bid** on jobs.

  * **Office staff selects winning bid** (not auto-awarded).

  * Providers execute tasks, log checklists, upload artifacts.

  * Job Sync posts updates into Salesforce Service Case.

**4\. Jira (Biomed/Internal Depot Service)**

* Purpose: Manage **internal refurb workflows**.

* Model: Each device \= Jira issue; subtasks \= refurb steps (Diagnostic, Repair, QA, Pack, Ready).

* Sync: IMS records device history; Salesforce Service Case shows milestones for customer visibility.

**5\. IMS (Inventory Management System / Device Master)**

* Purpose: **Canonical truth of devices**: serials, configs, ownership, refurb history.

* Inputs: Device events from Jira (biomed), MET (field work), Warehouse (parts consumption).

* Outputs: Unified device history visible to execs/support.

**6\. Warehouse/Catalog API**

* Purpose: **Stock, reservation, fulfillment of parts**.

* Called by: MET when part requested.

* Syncs to: IMS (parts consumed), SAP (financials).

**7\. SAP (Finance/ERP)**

* Purpose: **Financial \+ inventory control**.

* Functions: Parts PRs, invoices, AP/AR, payouts to contractors.

* Integrations: Receives consumption events from Warehouse/Jira; receives payout requests from MET.

**8\. Parts Prediction Engine**

* Purpose: **Predict parts needs** based on symptoms, error codes, and device history.

* Inputs: Device symptoms, error codes, model, previous repair history, failure patterns.

* Outputs: Suggested parts list with confidence scores, alternative parts, estimated costs.

* Integration: Called by Service Cloud during case creation, updated by MET during execution.

**9\. Parts Orchestrator**

* Purpose: **Coordinate parts movement** from warehouse to tech to return.

* Functions: Parts reservation, dispatch, tracking, return processing, cost reconciliation.

* Integrations: Warehouse API, MET, SAP, IMS, return shipping providers.

* Workflow: Reserve ‚Üí Dispatch ‚Üí Consume/Return ‚Üí Reconcile ‚Üí Report.

# **üì± Notification Standards & Parts Handling Protocols**

## **Notification Delivery Methods**

### **Customer Notifications**
* **Primary**: Email (confirmation, updates, completion)
* **Secondary**: SMS (urgent alerts, appointment reminders)
* **Escalation**: Outbound phone call (SLA breaches, critical issues)
* **Preference**: Customer-selected in Service Cloud profile

### **Provider Notifications**
* **Primary**: Push notification via MET mobile app
* **Secondary**: SMS (job awards, urgent updates)
* **Fallback**: Email (detailed instructions, documentation)

### **Internal Staff Notifications**
* **Primary**: Slack/Teams integration
* **Secondary**: Email (detailed reports, escalations)
* **Critical**: SMS (SLA breaches, system outages)

## **Parts Handling Strategy**

### **Pre-Visit Parts Planning**
1. **Initial Diagnosis**: CSR gathers symptoms, error codes, device history
2. **Parts Prediction**: System suggests likely parts based on symptoms + device model
3. **Parts Reservation**: Warehouse reserves predicted parts for tech pickup
4. **Tech Dispatch**: Tech arrives with pre-selected parts package

### **Parts Management During Visit**
1. **Confirmation**: Tech confirms actual parts needed vs. predicted
2. **Usage**: Parts consumed are logged in MET ‚Üí IMS + SAP
3. **Returns**: Unused expensive parts (>$100) must be returned within 24h
4. **Additional Needs**: If more parts required, tech requests via MET ‚Üí immediate dispatch

### **Parts Return Process**
1. **Unused Parts**: Tech scans unused parts in MET app
2. **Return Label**: System generates return shipping label
3. **Warehouse Credit**: Parts returned to available inventory
4. **Cost Avoidance**: Prevents expensive parts from being stranded

### **Follow-up Parts Scenarios**
1. **Wrong Parts Sent**: Tech requests correct parts ‚Üí immediate dispatch
2. **Additional Diagnosis**: Tech discovers secondary issues ‚Üí new parts request
3. **Return Visit**: If parts unavailable, schedule follow-up visit
4. **Cost Tracking**: All parts movements logged in SAP for billing reconciliation

### **Cost Management & Returns**
1. **Parts Threshold**: Parts >$100 require return within 24h
2. **Return Process**: Tech scans unused parts ‚Üí system generates return label ‚Üí warehouse credit
3. **Cost Avoidance**: Prevents expensive parts from being stranded at client sites
4. **Billing Impact**: Unused parts returned = no charge to client; used parts = full billing
5. **Inventory Accuracy**: Real-time updates prevent stock discrepancies and financial losses
